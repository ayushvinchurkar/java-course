Just as we follow rules like grammar in English, Java has a set of rules known as syntax that must be followed while writing programs. These rules define the structure and vocabulary of Java.

# Variables:
A variable acts as a container for storing values that can be modified during program execution.
Example:
int number = 8;
Here:
int is the data type,
number is the variable name,
8 is the value stored in the variable.

# Rules for Declaring Variable Names:
1. The name cannot start with a digit.
(Example: 1arry is invalid.)
2. Variable names are case-sensitive.
(Example: Ayush and ayush are considered different.)
3. The name must not be a keyword like void.
4. Whitespace is not allowed in variable names.
(Example: int Ayush Vinchurkar is invalid.)
5. Variable names can include letters, digits, the $ symbol, and _ (underscore), provided other rules are followed.

# Data Types:
Java data types are categorized into two types:

1. Primitive Data Types: Basic, built-in types such as int, char, and boolean.
2. Non-Primitive Data Types: More complex types derived from primitive types, such as arrays, classes, and interfaces.

# Primitive Data Types
Java is statically typed, i.e., variables must be declared before use. Java supports 8 primitive data types:

## Data Types in Java

| **Data Type** | **Size**     | **Value Range**                                                    |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `byte`        | 1 byte       | -128 to 127                                                       |
| `short`       | 2 bytes      | -32,768 to 32,767                                                 |
| `int`         | 4 bytes      | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                                   |
| `float`       | 4 bytes      | 3.40282347 × 10³⁸ to 1.40239846 × 10⁻⁴⁵                          |
| `long`        | 8 bytes      | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807           |
| `double`      | 8 bytes      | 1.7976931348623157 × 10³⁰⁸ to 4.9406564584124654 × 10⁻³²⁴        |
| `char`        | 2 bytes      | 0 to 65,535                                                       |
| `boolean`     | Depends on JVM | `true` or `false`                                              |
