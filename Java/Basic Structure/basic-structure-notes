# Explanation of the "Hello World" Program:

package com.company:
Packages in Java are used to group related classes together.
The package keyword is used to define a package in Java.
Here, com.company is the name of the package.

public class Main:
In Java, every program must have at least one class.
The class name should match the filename.
In this program, a class named Main is created, which serves as the entry point for the application.

public static void main(String[] args) { ... }:
This is the main() method, which is the starting point of every Java program.
The program's execution begins from this method.

System.out.println("Hello World");:
This statement is used to display output on the screen.
Any text placed within the quotation marks will be printed as it is.



# Java Naming Conventions:

For classes, we use Pascal Convention. The first and Subsequent characters from a word are capital letters (uppercase).
Example: Main, MyScanner, MyEmployee

For functions and variables, we use camelCaseConvention. Here the first character is lowercase, and the subsequent characters are uppercase like myScanner, myMarks
