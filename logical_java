Relational Operators in Java : 
Relational operators are used to evaluate conditions (true or false) inside the if statements. Some examples of relational operators are:

== (equals)
>= (greater than or equals to)
> (greater than)
< (less than)
<= (less than or equals to)
!= (not equals)
Note: ‘=’ is used for an assignment whereas ‘==’ is used for equality check. The condition can be either true or false.

Logical Operators : 
Logical operators are used to provide logic to our Java programs.
There are three types of logical operators in Java :
&& - AND
|| - OR
! – NOT
AND Operator : 
Evaluates to true if both the conditions are true.

Y && Y = Y                
Y && N = N
N && Y = N
N && N = N
Convention: # Y – True and N - False

OR Operator :
Evaluates to true when at least one of the conditions is true.

Y || Y = Y                   
Y || N = Y
N || Y = Y
N || N = N
Convention: # Y – True and N - False

NOT Operator :
Negates the given logic (true becomes false and vice-versa)

!Y = N                         
!N = Y
